I was searching for ns2 ubuntu .deb packages for a long time.I have written many blogs for the manual installation of ns2 on linux and windows.Still I do get many queries of ns2 installation errors.

There is a ppa repository for ns2 created by *Wouter Horr√©*.Now its very easy to install ns2 on ubuntu.

Since Ubuntu 9.10 is already being shipped with tcl,otcl,tk, you need not to install these packages, Only ns, nam & xgraph are needed to install.

If you are behind a proxy, make sure you have $http_proxy variable configured in *~/.bashrc* or type the following in the terminal

`export http_proxy=http://ipaddr:port`

If you had followed my previous post to install ns2 on linux, delete the ns2 folder and paths using

`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/ns-allinone-2.34 && sudo rm -f /etc/profile.d/ns2.sh`

Type the following command on a terminal :

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wouterh && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ns nam xgraph`

There is no need to set-up any path, environment variables or make any changes in *~/.bashrc* or */etc/profile* file.

Run it using the command

`ns filename.tcl`
