Windows 7 boasts a lot of great new shortcuts for switching between apps, moving windows around your screen, moving them to another monitor altogether, and much more. But I’m focusing on several of my favorites.

`Win+Home` Clear all but the active window.

`Win+Space` All windows become transparent so you can see through to the desktop.

`Win+Up arrow` Maximize the active window.

`Shift+Win+Up arrow` Maximize the active window vertically.

`Win+Down arrow` Minimize the window/Restore the window if it’s maximized.

`Win+Left/Right arrows` Dock the window to each side of the monitor.

`Alt+Up` Goes up a folder level in Windows Explorer.

`Alt+P` Toggles the preview pane in Windows Explorer.
